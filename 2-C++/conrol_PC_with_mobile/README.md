# PC Control Using Sockets
## Description

This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to control your laptop remotely using a mobile application. 
By establishing a socket connection between your laptop and the mobile app, you can perform various actions on your laptop, 
such as opening applications like the `Calendar`, `VS Code`, `Firefox`, `Calculator`, `Emojis`, `Text Editor`, `Todo`, `Terminal`, and finally get your IP.

- To run the app on your PC use the following commands:
  * `g++ -g -fno-elide-constructors -O0 main.cpp executor.cpp Socket.cpp`
  * `valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./a.out`

## Usage

We have 2 classes here executor and Socket below you will see the UML Diagram for both of them.

The executor class is a C++ class that provides functionality for executing predefined commands. It maintains a database of commands and their corresponding actions. The class allows you to execute commands, execute commands and return the output, show the available commands, and check if a command exists in the database.

The class utilizes the [popen](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696799/functions/popen.html) function to execute the commands and retrieve their output.

The Socket class represents a server socket that listens for incoming connections and handles client connections.
